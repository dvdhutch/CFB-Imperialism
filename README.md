# College Football Imperialism Map

Interactive college football imperialism web app. Built for college football fans to visualize undefeated teams and simulate game outcomes. **Last updated: August 20, 2025.**

## üèà How It Works

- Teams start with the counties closest to their home stadium
- Winning teams take losing teams' land
- As the season progresses, defeated teams will be removed, leaving only undefeated teams
- FCS wins/losses do not count towards totals

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Stack

- **React 19** + TypeScript
- **D3.js** for map visualization
- **Vite** for build tooling

## Acknowledgments

### Concept
This project is inspired by the original College Football Imperialism Map by [Ryan P. Meyer](https://github.com/ryanpmeyer/CFBImperialism).

### Community Inspiration
Primarily inspired by the [r/CFB](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/) and this map (like the [2025 FBS Imperialism Map Preseason](https://imgur.com/a/2025-fbs-imperialism-map-preseason-zTlcklk)).
